# what us input() function in python?
# The input() function in Python is used to take input from the user. When this function is called,
# the program waits for the user to type something and press the Enter key. The input provided  
# 
#Tecnically, the input() function reads a line from input, converts it into a string (stripping any 
# trailing newline), and returns that.  
# 
# name = input("Enter your name: ")
# age = input("Enter your age: ")
# print("Hello,", name, "you are", age, "years old")  

# in input function is always treated as a string.


# Typecasting in python:
# Typecasting is the process of converting a variable from one data type to another.
# In Python, you can use built-in functions to perform typecasting. Some common typecasting functions include:
# int(): Converts a value to an integer.
# float(): Converts a value to a floating-point number.
# str(): Converts a value to a string.
# bool(): Converts a value to a Boolean (True or False). 

# Example of typecasting:
# converting string to integer:

# age = input("Enter your age: ")  # input() returns a string
# age = int(age)  # typecasting string to integer
# print("Your age is:", age)
# print("Type of age before typecasting:", type(age))

# temperature = input("Enter the temperature in Celsius: ")
# temperature = float(temperature)  # typecasting string to float
# print(type(temperature))


# Convert number to string:
# sales = 10000
# total_sales = "The total sales is " + str(sales)
# print(total_sales)
# print(type(total_sales))
