# what is comments in python? 
# Comments in Python are lines of text that are not executed as part of the program.
# They are used to provide explanations, notes, or annotations within the code to improve readability and understanding.
# In Python, comments are created by placing a hash symbol (#) before the text of the comment.

#What is variables in python?
# Variables in Python are used to store data values. They act as containers that hold information which 
# can be referenced and manipulated throughout the program.
# In Python, you can create a variable by simply assigning a value to a name using the equals sign (=).

# rulles of the variable naming in python:
# 1. A variable name must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_).
# 2. The rest of the variable name can contain letters, numbers (0-9), and underscores (_).
# 3. Variable names are case-sensitive, meaning that "myVariable" and "myvariable" are considered different variables.
# 4. Variable names cannot be the same as Python reserved keywords (e.g., if, else, while, for, etc.).
# 5. Variable names should not contain spaces. Instead, use underscores (_) to separate words (e.g., my_variable).
# 6. Variable names should be descriptive and meaningful to enhance code readability.

# good variable names:
# 1. user_name
# 2. total_amount
# 3. is_valid
# 4. product_list
# 5. age34  

# bad variable names:
# 1. 2ndPlace (starts with a number)
# 2. total amount (contains a space)
# 3. if (reserved keyword)
# 4. user-name (contains a hyphen)
# 5. x (not descriptive)

# name = "Mukul"
# age = 30
# Salary = 45000.50

# print("Wahat is my name?", name)
# print("Wahat is my age?", age)
# print("Wahat is my Salary?", Salary)

# print("My name is ",name + ", my age is ",str(age) + " and my Salary is ",str(Salary))



# What is data types in python?
# Data types in Python refer to the classification or categorization of data items.
# They define the type of value that a variable can hold and determine the operations that can be performed on that data.
# Python has several built-in data types, including:
# 1. Numeric Types: int (integer), float (floating-point number), complex (complex number)
# 2. Text Types: str (string), list (ordered collection), tuple (ordered, immutable collection)
# 3. Mapping Type: dict (dictionary, key-value pairs)
# 4. Set Types: set (unordered collection of unique elements), frozenset (immutable set)
# 5. Boolean Type: bool (True or False)
# 6. None Type: NoneType (represents the absence of a value)
 
# 1. Text type in python:
# String (str):


# customer_name = "Mukul"
# print("Customer Name:", customer_name)
# print("Type of customer_name:", type(customer_name))

# 2.1 Numeric types in python: integer (int):

# customer_name = "Mukul"
# customer_age = 30

# print("Customer Name:", customer_name)
# print("Type of customer_name:", type(customer_name))
# print("Customer Age:", customer_age)
# print("Type of customer_age:", type(customer_age))

# 2.2 Floating-point (float):
# customer_name = "Mukul"
# customer_age = 30
# salary = 15000.25

# print("Customer Name:", customer_name)
# print("Type of customer_name:", type(customer_name))
# print("Customer Age:", customer_age)
# print("Type of customer_age:", type(customer_age))
# print("Salary:", salary)
# print("Type of salary:", type(salary))
 


# 2.3 Complex Number (complex):
# customer_name = "Mukul"
# customer_age = 30
# salary = 15000.25
# account_balance = 5000 + 3j
# print("Customer Name:", customer_name)
# print("Type of customer_name:", type(customer_name))
# print("Customer Age:", customer_age)
# print("Type of customer_age:", type(customer_age))
# print("Salary:", salary)
# print("Type of salary:", type(salary))
# print("Account Balance:", account_balance)
# print("Type of account_balance:", type(account_balance))

# 3. Boolean Type (bool):
# customer_name = "Mukul"
# customer_age = 30
# salary = 15000.25
# is_active = True    
# print("Customer Name:", customer_name)
# print("Type of customer_name:", type(customer_name))
# print("Customer Age:", customer_age)
# print("Type of customer_age:", type(customer_age))
# print("Salary:", salary)
# print("Type of salary:", type(salary))
# print("Is Active:", is_active)
# print("Type of is_active:", type(is_active))

# 4.sequence types in python:
# 4.1 List (list): mutable ordered collection of items.
#

# fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
# print("Fruits List:", fruits) 
# print("Type of fruits:", type(fruits))

# 4.2 Tuple (tuple): immutable ordered collection of items.

# fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
# print("Fruits Tuple:", fruits) 
# print("Type of fruits:", type(fruits))  

# FIXME: 4.3 Range (range): represents a sequence of numbers.
#  uyryuryu

# numbers = range(1, 10)
# print(list(numbers))
# print("Type of numbers:", type(numbers))

# 5. Mapping Type in python:
# Dictionary (dict): collection of key-value pairs.

# customer = {
#     "name": "Mukul",
#     "age": 30,
#     "salary": 15000.25
# }
# print("Customer Dictionary:", customer)
# print("Type of customer:", type(customer))

# 6 Set Types in python:
# 6.1 Set (set): unordered collection of unique items.
# unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3,3, 4, 5}
# print("Unique Numbers Set:", unique_numbers)
# print("Type of unique_numbers:", type(unique_numbers))

# 6.2 Frozen Set (frozenset): immutable version of a set.
# unique_numbers = frozenset([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
# print("Unique Numbers Frozen Set:", unique_numbers)
# print("Type of unique_numbers:", type(unique_numbers))  

# difference between set and frozenset:

# The main difference between a set and a frozenset in Python is mutability.
# A set is mutable, meaning you can add or remove elements after its creation, while a frozenset is immutable,

# 7. none type in python:
# NoneType: represents the absence of a value.
# value = None
# print("Value:", value)
# print("Type of value:", type(value))
